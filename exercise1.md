For this exercise, let’s assume the application is being developed with TypeScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. In a CI pipeline for this stack, the first step is usually linting. The most common tool is ESLint, which helps enforce coding style and catch errors early. For formatting, many teams use Prettier to ensure consistent code style across the project. Testing can be handled with Jest, which works well for both frontend (React) and backend (Node) code. If we need more advanced end-to-end testing, Playwright or Cypress are popular choices. The build step typically involves using Webpack, Vite, or the built-in Next.js build system if the frontend is structured that way.

While Jenkins and GitHub Actions are popular CI/CD tools, there are many other alternatives. GitLab CI/CD is tightly integrated into GitLab repositories and provides strong pipeline features. CircleCI is known for speed and scalability, while Travis CI has long been used in the open-source community. Cloud providers like Azure DevOps Pipelines or AWS CodePipeline also offer managed CI/CD services.

When considering whether to use a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment, the decision depends on the team’s needs. A cloud-based setup like GitHub Actions or CircleCI is usually faster to adopt, easier to scale, and reduces maintenance overhead—ideal for a team of six developers preparing for release. A self-hosted solution could make sense if we needed more control over infrastructure, strict compliance, or integration with on-premise systems. To decide, we would need details such as project sensitivity, security requirements, budget, and how frequently builds are expected to run.
